<h4>The 'Why'</h4>
I had known for a long time that I was interested in starting a business.  I was doing contract work for someone who was selling guides on running Estate Sale businesses.  After learning about how estate sales are run, I decided this was something I could start with my current financial situation.  I figured it couldn't hurt to have some business experience before starting a software startup.

<h4>The 'How'</h4>

Lots and lots of extremely hard work.  I learned more about myself and running a business than I ever expected to.  Logistically speaking, this business was based out of Denver while I was still living in East Vail.  A friend letting me stay on his couch near downtown Denver was a big help.  Thanks Mike!

<h4>The Output</h4>

While the enterprise could have continued to support me, after three months I decided that the earnings weren't worth the stress and strain on my personal life.  I "closed up shop" and returned to Vail to get a job collecting a paycheck.  Not to say that I didn't come away with a plethora of lessons about both business and myself.

<h4>What I Learned</h4>

I could write a book covering everything I learned while running an estate sale business, as I'm sure is the case for anyone who has singlehandedly started and ran a service business.  Besides learning a lot about myself and my personal capacity for perseverance, self-motivation, and determination, I learned a little bit about a lot of different areas of running a business.  I did everything; marketing, sales, hiring, managing, scheduling, advertising, moving, organizing, outsourcing, listing, bookkeeping, payroll, systemization, and anything else that needed to get done.  While I wouldn't say that I became a master in any of these areas, I certainly learned enough about all of them to get me by.  This only increased my respect for all of these different fields and areas of a business.
