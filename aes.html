<h3>Step-Through Visualizer of AES</h3>
<h4>The 'Why'</h4>
<p>I took a class on encryption during college, and we had assignments to encrypt data by hand.  I wished something like this existed when I would encounter problems where my output did not match the answer key.  So I 'ate my own dog food' and built this.</p>

<h4>The 'How'</h4>

<p>HTML and vanilla Javascript.</p>

<h4>The Demo/Code</h4>

<p><a href='./aes_visualizer.html' >Click here to use the AES step through tool</a>.  To see the code powering it, simply right click on the page and view the page source.</p>

<h4>Assumptions and Known Shortcomings</h4>

<p>I assume that the end user knows about hexadecimal notation, versus binary or decimal.  I don't do any validation on the input, the end user could put in 0xGG for any of the hex fields and they won't get any kind of warning.</p>

<h4>Possible Expansion</h4>

<p>Allow input and output to be in binary, or decimal, or octal notation.  Add support for 192- and 256-bit keys.  Add a page that explains and steps through the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijndael_key_schedule' target='_blank' title='Rijndael Key Expansion on Wikipedia' >Key Expansion process</a>.</p>
